                    Pendant lamps are the best choice of lighting for a modern home interior. 
                    When it comes to pendant lights, make sure you choose something that has
                    an extraordinary, unusual design – one that calls attention and can 
                    trigger visual focus upward.</p>

                    <h2 id="h2_2">ADD A POP OF BRIGHT RED</h2>
                    <p id="p_6">Adding a pop of cherry red can finish a scheme even if it seems like it
                    won’t fit with the rest of the décor. For a low-risk option, try adding a 
                    bright red lampshade, scatter cushion or picture frame and see if it brings the room to life.</p>

                    <p id="p_6">Adding a softness to interiors that looks both modern and classic. We love
                    how this clever bedroom design turns a useful storage solution into a cool feature. 
                    It also cleverly echoes the asymmetric curve of the headboard. </p>

                    <h2  id="h2_2">PLAN THOROUGHFARES</h2>
                    <p id="p_6">A common design mistakes is cramming too much furniture into an 
                    area without leaving enough room to walk around comfortably. The 
                    most frequently-used thoroughfares in your home should be at least 90cm wide</p>

                    <h2 id="h2_2">FLOORING COHESIVE</h2>
                    <p id="p_6">Using the same flooring throughout different rooms or areas in your home
                    is an easy way to make the space feel much bigger than it is. If you have large, open-plan
                    rooms, use rugs to break up the continuity and divide the space according to use.</p>

                    <h2  id="h2_2">BALANCE COLOR SCHEME</h2>
                    <p id="p_6">Stick to 60% for dominant colour, 30% for secondary colour and 10% 
                    for accent colour and you’ll find it hard to go wrong. To add a fourth colour into the
                    mix, split the secondary colour or, at a push, the dominant colour, but never the accent. </p>
